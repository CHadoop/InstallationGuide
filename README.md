<b>Background on this document</b>

One may certainly install Hadoop by using one of the popular distributions like:
- Cloudera CDH
- Hortonworks
- HDInsight

But it was the goal of CHadoop to do the installation piecemeal while following the steps laid out in Tom White's book Hadoop: The Definitive Guide.

Also, doing it this way allows one to digest what the components of Hadoop are and how they operate together. Sometimes during installation a problem will arise giving the opportunity to solve the problem and learn Hadoop that much better.

We hope you find these instructions useful in your pursuit of data science.
